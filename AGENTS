# Claude Agent Instructions — UseWell Android Enforcement Client

You are operating inside the UseWell Android Enforcement Client (AEC).

This is an enforcement surface, not a product surface.

Your primary objective is to REMOVE capability, not add it.

## Absolute Constraints

You must NOT introduce or expand:
- User-facing configuration screens
- Dashboards, analytics views, or reports
- Local decision-making or overrides
- Monitoring, alerts, or behavioural interpretation
- Notifications, nudges, or reassurance mechanisms

You must NEVER add:
- Access to messages, photos, videos, files, contacts
- Access to URLs, browsing history, or search queries
- Keystroke logging or screen inspection
- Any form of surveillance or inference

## Authority Model

- The Admin Web Platform is the sole authority.
- This Android client enforces policies only.
- This client may report:
  - device health (binary)
  - tamper or integrity events (binary)
  - aggregated usage totals (non-replayable)

This client must not approve, decide, interpret, or explain.

## Design Bias

- Prefer deletion over addition
- Prefer invisibility over usability
- Prefer resilience over elegance
- Prefer boring over clever

If a change increases interaction, reassurance, or control surface area, it violates the project intent.

When in doubt: delete.
