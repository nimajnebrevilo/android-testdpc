UseWell Android Enforcement Client — Constitutional Constraints

This client must never:

- Access messages, photos, videos, files, contacts, URLs, or browsing history
- Monitor behaviour, generate alerts, or interpret activity
- Provide dashboards optimised for parental vigilance
- Make local policy decisions or temporary overrides
- Optimise for engagement, DAU, or time-in-app

Authority model:

- The Admin Web Platform is the sole authority
- The Android client enforces policy only
- The Android client may report device health and aggregated usage totals
- The Android client may relay requests but never approve them

Success is measured by stability, invisibility, and lack of interaction.
